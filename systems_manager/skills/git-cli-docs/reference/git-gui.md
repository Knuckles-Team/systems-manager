##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_name)NAME
git-gui - A portable graphical interface to Git
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_synopsis)SYNOPSIS
```
_git gui_ [<command>] [<arguments>]
```

##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_description)DESCRIPTION
A Tcl/Tk based graphical user interface to Git. _git gui_ focuses on allowing users to make changes to their repository by making new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches, performing local merges, and fetching/pushing to remote repositories.
Unlike _gitk_ , _git gui_ focuses on commit generation and single file annotation and does not show project history. It does however supply menu actions to start a _gitk_ session from within _git gui_.
_git gui_ is known to work on all popular UNIX systems, Mac OS X, and Windows (under both Cygwin and MSYS). To the extent possible OS specific user interface guidelines are followed, making _git gui_ a fairly native interface for users.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_commands)COMMANDS 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-blame)blame 
    
Start a blame viewer on the specified file on the given version (or working directory if not specified). 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-browser)browser 
    
Start a tree browser showing all files in the specified commit. Files selected through the browser are opened in the blame viewer. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-citool)citool 
    
Start _git gui_ and arrange to make exactly one commit before exiting and returning to the shell. The interface is limited to only commit actions, slightly reducing the application’s startup time and simplifying the menubar. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-version)version 
    
Display the currently running version of _git gui_.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_examples)Examples 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguiblameMakefile)`git` `gui` `blame` `Makefile` 
    
Show the contents of the file _Makefile_ in the current working directory, and provide annotations for both the original author of each line, and who moved the line to its current location. The uncommitted file is annotated, and uncommitted changes (if any) are explicitly attributed to _Not Yet Committed_. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguiblamev0998Makefile)`git` `gui` `blame` `v0.99.8` `Makefile` 
    
Show the contents of _Makefile_ in revision _v0.99.8_ and provide annotations for each line. Unlike the above example the file is read from the object database and not the working directory. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguiblame--line100Makefile)`git` `gui` `blame` `--line=100` `Makefile` 
    
Loads annotations as described above and automatically scrolls the view to center on line _100_. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguicitool)`git` `gui` `citool` 
    
Make one commit and return to the shell when it is complete. This command returns a non-zero exit code if the window was closed in any way other than by making a commit. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguicitool--amend)`git` `gui` `citool` `--amend` 
    
Automatically enter the _Amend Last Commit_ mode of the interface. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguicitool--nocommit)`git` `gui` `citool` `--nocommit` 
    
Behave as normal citool, but instead of making a commit simply terminate with a zero exit code. It still checks that the index does not contain any unmerged entries, so you can use it as a GUI version of [git-mergetool[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool) 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitcitool)`git` `citool` 
    
Same as `git` `gui` `citool` (above). 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitguibrowsermaint)`git` `gui` `browser` `maint` 
    
Show a browser for the tree of the _maint_ branch. Files selected in the browser can be viewed with the internal blame viewer.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_see_also)SEE ALSO 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#Documentation/git-gui.txt-gitk1)[gitk[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) 
    
The Git repository browser. Shows branches, commit history and file differences. gitk is the utility started by _git gui_ 's Repository Visualize actions.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui#_other)Other
_git gui_ is actually maintained as an independent project, but stable versions are distributed as part of the Git suite for the convenience of end users.
The official repository of the _git gui_ project can be found at:
