##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#_description)DESCRIPTION
Manage the serialized commit-graph file.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#_options)OPTIONS 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt---object-dir)--object-dir 
    
Use given directory for the location of packfiles and commit-graph file. This parameter exists to specify the location of an alternate that only has the objects directory, not a full `.git` directory. The commit-graph file is expected to be in the _< dir>_`/info` directory and the packfiles are expected to be in _< dir>_`/pack`. If the directory could not be made into an absolute path, or does not match any known object directory, `git` `commit-graph` ... will exit with non-zero status. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt---progress)--progress 


[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt---no-progress)--no-progress 
    
Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified, progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#_commands)COMMANDS 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt-write)_write_ 
    
Write a commit-graph file based on the commits found in packfiles. If the config option `core.commitGraph` is disabled, then this command will output a warning, then return success without writing a commit-graph file.
With the `--stdin-packs` option, generate the new commit graph by walking objects only in the specified pack-indexes. (Cannot be combined with `--stdin-commits` or `--reachable`.)
With the `--stdin-commits` option, generate the new commit graph by walking commits starting at the commits specified in stdin as a list of OIDs in hex, one OID per line. OIDs that resolve to non-commits (either directly, or by peeling tags) are silently ignored. OIDs that are malformed, or do not exist generate an error. (Cannot be combined with `--stdin-packs` or `--reachable`.)
With the `--reachable` option, generate the new commit graph by walking commits starting at all refs. (Cannot be combined with `--stdin-commits` or `--stdin-packs`.)
With the `--append` option, include all commits that are present in the existing commit-graph file.
With the `--changed-paths` option, compute and write information about the paths changed between a commit and its first parent. This operation can take a while on large repositories. It provides significant performance gains for getting history of a directory or a file with `git` `log` `--` _< path>_. If this option is given, future commit-graph writes will automatically assume that this option was intended. Use `--no-changed-paths` to stop storing this data. `--changed-paths` is implied by config `commitGraph.changedPaths=true`.
With the `--max-new-filters=`_< n>_ option, generate at most `n` new Bloom filters (if `--changed-paths` is specified). If `n` is `-1`, no limit is enforced. Only commits present in the new layer count against this limit. To retroactively compute Bloom filters over earlier layers, it is advised to use `--split=replace`. Overrides the `commitGraph.maxNewFilters` configuration.
With the `--split`[`=`_< strategy>_] option, write the commit-graph as a chain of multiple commit-graph files stored in _< dir>_`/info/commit-graphs`. Commit-graph layers are merged based on the strategy and other splitting options. The new commits not already in the commit-graph are added in a new "tip" file. This file is merged with the existing file if the following merge conditions are met:
  * If `--split=no-merge` is specified, a merge is never performed, and the remaining options are ignored. `--split=replace` overwrites the existing chain with a new one. A bare `--split` defers to the remaining options. (Note that merging a chain of commit graphs replaces the existing chain with a length-1 chain where the first and only incremental holds the entire graph).
  * If `--size-multiple=`_< X>_ is not specified, let `X` equal 2. If the new tip file would have `N` commits and the previous tip has `M` commits and `X` times `N` is greater than `M`, instead merge the two files into a single file.
  * If `--max-commits=`_< M>_ is specified with `M` a positive integer, and the new tip file would have more than `M` commits, then instead merge the new tip with the previous tip.
Finally, if `--expire-time=`_< datetime>_ is not specified, let `datetime` be the current time. After writing the split commit-graph, delete all unused commit-graph whose modified times are older than `datetime`.

Read the commit-graph file and verify its contents against the object database. Used to check for corrupted data.
With the `--shallow` option, only check the tip commit-graph file in a chain of split commit-graphs.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#_examples)EXAMPLES
  * Write a commit-graph file for the packed commits in your local `.git` directory.
```
$ git commit-graph write
```

  * Write a commit-graph file, extending the current commit-graph file using commits in _< pack-index>_.
```
$ echo <pack-index> | git commit-graph write --stdin-packs
```

  * Write a commit-graph file containing all reachable commits.
```
$ git show-ref -s | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits
```

  * Write a commit-graph file containing all commits in the current commit-graph file along with those reachable from `HEAD`.
```
$ git rev-parse HEAD | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits --append
```



##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#_configuration)CONFIGURATION
Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the [git-config[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) documentation. The content is the same as what’s found there: 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt-commitGraphgenerationVersion)commitGraph.generationVersion 
    
Specifies the type of generation number version to use when writing or reading the commit-graph file. If version 1 is specified, then the corrected commit dates will not be written or read. Defaults to 2. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt-commitGraphmaxNewFilters)commitGraph.maxNewFilters 
    
Specifies the default value for the `--max-new-filters` option of `git` `commit-graph` `write` (c.f., [git-commit-graph[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph)). 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt-commitGraphchangedPaths)commitGraph.changedPaths 
    
If true, then `git` `commit-graph` `write` will compute and write changed-path Bloom filters by default, equivalent to passing `--changed-paths`. If false or unset, changed-paths Bloom filters will be written during `git` `commit-graph` `write` only if the filters already exist in the current commit-graph file. This matches the default behavior of `git` `commit-graph` `write` without any `--`[`no-`]`changed-paths` option. To rewrite a commit-graph file without any filters, use the `--no-changed-paths` option. Command-line option `--`[`no-`]`changed-paths` always takes precedence over this configuration. Defaults to unset. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt-commitGraphreadChangedPaths)commitGraph.readChangedPaths 
    
Deprecated. Equivalent to commitGraph.changedPathsVersion=-1 if true, and commitGraph.changedPathsVersion=0 if false. (If commitGraph.changedPathVersion is also set, commitGraph.changedPathsVersion takes precedence.) 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit-graph#Documentation/git-commit-graph.txt-commitGraphchangedPathsVersion)commitGraph.changedPathsVersion 
    
Specifies the version of the changed-path Bloom filters that Git will read and write. May be -1, 0, 1, or 2. Note that values greater than 1 may be incompatible with older versions of Git which do not yet understand those versions. Use caution when operating in a mixed-version environment.
Defaults to -1.
If -1, Git will use the version of the changed-path Bloom filters in the repository, defaulting to 1 if there are none.
If 0, Git will not read any Bloom filters, and will write version 1 Bloom filters when instructed to write.
If 1, Git will only read version 1 Bloom filters, and will write version 1 Bloom filters.
If 2, Git will only read version 2 Bloom filters, and will write version 2 Bloom filters.
