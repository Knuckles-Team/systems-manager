##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree#_name)NAME
git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree#_synopsis)SYNOPSIS
```
git write-tree [--missing-ok] [--prefix=_<prefix>_/]
```

##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree#_description)DESCRIPTION
Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new tree object is printed to standard output.
The index must be in a fully merged state.
Conceptually, `git` `write-tree` sync()s the current index contents into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a `git` `update-index` phase before you did the `git` `write-tree`.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree#_options)OPTIONS 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree#Documentation/git-write-tree.txt---missing-ok)`--missing-ok` 
    
Normally `git` `write-tree` ensures that the objects referenced by the directory exist in the object database. This option disables this check. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree#Documentation/git-write-tree.txt---prefixprefix)`--prefix=`_< prefix>_`/` 
    
Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory _< prefix>_. This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory.
