# Git and Software Freedom Conservancy
Git is a member project of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/). Conservancy is a not-for-profit organization that provides financial and administrative assistance to open source projects. 
## Donation
Conservancy accepts donations on git's behalf. In the past, project money has typically gone to defraying travel costs for developers to come to our annual [GitTogether](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitTogether) mini-conference. A portion of the money goes to Conservancy to cover their operating expenses. You can also donate [directly](https://sfconservancy.org/donate) to Software Freedom Conservancy's general fund. 
### Paypal
