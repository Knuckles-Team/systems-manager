##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_name)NAME
gitk - The Git repository browser
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_synopsis)SYNOPSIS
```
_gitk_ [<options>] [<revision-range>] [--] [<path>…​]
```

##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_description)DESCRIPTION
Displays changes in a repository or a selected set of commits. This includes visualizing the commit graph, showing information related to each commit, and the files in the trees of each revision.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_options)OPTIONS
To control which revisions to show, gitk supports most options applicable to the _git rev-list_ command. It also supports a few options applicable to the _git diff-*_ commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown. Finally, it supports some gitk-specific options.
gitk generally only understands options with arguments in the _stuck_ form (see [gitcli[7]](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcli)) due to limitations in the command-line parser.
###  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_rev_list_options_and_arguments)rev-list options and arguments
This manual page describes only the most frequently used options. See [git-rev-list[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-list) for a complete list. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---all)--all 
    
Show all refs (branches, tags, etc.). 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---branchespattern)--branches[=<pattern>] 


[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---tagspattern)--tags[=<pattern>] 


[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---remotespattern)--remotes[=<pattern>] 
    
Pretend as if all the branches (tags, remote branches, resp.) are listed on the command line as _< commit>_. If _< pattern>_ is given, limit refs to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks _?_ , _*_ , or _[_ , _/*_ at the end is implied. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---sincedate)--since=<date> 
    
Show commits more recent than a specific date. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---untildate)--until=<date> 
    
Show commits older than a specific date. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---date-order)--date-order 
    
Sort commits by date when possible. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---merge)--merge 
    
After an attempt to merge stops with conflicts, show the commits on the history between two branches (i.e. the HEAD and the MERGE_HEAD) that modify the conflicted files and do not exist on all the heads being merged. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---left-right)--left-right 
    
Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is reachable from. Commits from the left side are prefixed with a _<_ symbol and those from the right with a _>_ symbol. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---full-history)--full-history 
    
When filtering history with _< path>…​_, does not prune some history. (See "History simplification" in [git-log[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) for a more detailed explanation.) 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---simplify-merges)--simplify-merges 
    
Additional option to `--full-history` to remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits contributing to this merge. (See "History simplification" in [git-log[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) for a more detailed explanation.) 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---ancestry-path)--ancestry-path 
    
When given a range of commits to display (e.g. _commit1..commit2_ or _commit2 ^commit1_), only display commits that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the _commit1_ and _commit2_ , i.e. commits that are both descendants of _commit1_ , and ancestors of _commit2_. (See "History simplification" in [git-log[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) for a more detailed explanation.) 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt--Lstartendfile)`-L`_< start>_`,`_< end>_`:`_< file>_ 


[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt--Lfuncnamefile)`-L:`_< funcname>_`:`_< file>_ 
    
Trace the evolution of the line range given by _< start>_`,`_< end>_, or by the function name regex _< funcname>_, within the _< file>_. You may not give any pathspec limiters. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single revision, i.e., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments, and _< start>_ and _< end>_ (or _< funcname>_) must exist in the starting revision. You can specify this option more than once. Implies `--patch`. Patch output can be suppressed using `--no-patch`, but other diff formats (namely `--raw`, `--numstat`, `--shortstat`, `--dirstat`, `--summary`, `--name-only`, `--name-status`, `--check`) are not currently implemented.
_< start>_ and _< end>_ can take one of these forms:
  * _< number>_
If _< start>_ or _< end>_ is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).
  * `/`_< regex>_`/`
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX _< regex>_. If _< start>_ is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous `-L` range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If _< start>_ is `^/`_< regex>_`/`, it will search from the start of file. If _< end>_ is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by _< start>_.
  * `+`_< offset>_ or `-`_< offset>_
This is only valid for _< end>_ and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by _< start>_.


If `:`_< funcname>_ is given in place of _< start>_ and _< end>_, it is a regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches _< funcname>_, up to the next funcname line. `:`_< funcname>_ searches from the end of the previous `-L` range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. `^:`_< funcname>_ searches from the start of file. The function names are determined in the same way as `git` `diff` works out patch hunk headers (see _Defining a custom hunk-header_ in [gitattributes[5]](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes)). 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt-revisionrange)<revision range> 
    
Limit the revisions to show. This can be either a single revision meaning show from the given revision and back, or it can be a range in the form "_< from>_.._< to>_" to show all revisions between _< from>_ and back to _< to>_. Note, more advanced revision selection can be applied. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see [gitrevisions[7]](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions). 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt-path)<path>…​ 
    
Limit commits to the ones touching files in the given paths. Note, to avoid ambiguity with respect to revision names use "--" to separate the paths from any preceding options.
###  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_gitk_specific_options)gitk-specific options 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---argscmdcommand)--argscmd=<command> 
    
Command to be run each time gitk has to determine the revision range to show. The command is expected to print on its standard output a list of additional revisions to be shown, one per line. Use this instead of explicitly specifying a _< revision-range>_ if the set of commits to show may vary between refreshes. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt---select-commitref)--select-commit=<ref> 
    
Select the specified commit after loading the graph. Default behavior is equivalent to specifying _--select-commit=HEAD_.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_examples)Examples 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt-gitkv2612includescsidriversscsi)gitk v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi 
    
Show the changes since version _v2.6.12_ that changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt-gitk--since2weeksago--gitk)gitk --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk 
    
Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file _gitk_. The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the **branch** named _gitk_ 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#Documentation/gitk.txt-gitk--max-count100--all--Makefile)gitk --max-count=100 --all -- Makefile 
    
Show at most 100 changes made to the file _Makefile_. Instead of only looking for changes in the current branch look in all branches.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_files)Files
User configuration and preferences are stored at:
  * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/gitk` if it exists, otherwise
  * `$HOME/.gitk` if it exists


If neither of the above exist then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/gitk` is created and used by default. If _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME_ is not set it defaults to `$HOME/.config` in all cases.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk#_history)History
Gitk was the first graphical repository browser, written by Paul Mackerras in Tcl/Tk.
_gitk_ is actually maintained as an independent project, but stable versions are distributed as part of the Git suite for the convenience of end users.
`gitk-git/` comes from Johannes Sixt’s gitk project:
