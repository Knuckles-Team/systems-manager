This content is available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/tree/gh-pages?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme). Bug reports and suggestions may be made in that repository.

Bug reports and suggestions on the technical content or English language version of the book should be made in the progit2 repository. Fixes for translated versions of the book should be made in the [ appropriate language-specific repository](https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md#helping-with-a-existing-project).
