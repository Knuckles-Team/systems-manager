##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#_name)NAME
git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing merging
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#_synopsis)SYNOPSIS
```
_git merge-index_ [-o] [-q] <merge-program> (-a | ( [--] <file>…​) )
```

##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#_description)DESCRIPTION
This looks up the <file>(s) in the index and, if there are any merge entries, passes the SHA-1 hash for those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and <file> as argument 4. File modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#_options)OPTIONS 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#Documentation/git-merge-index.txt---)-- 
    
Do not interpret any more arguments as options. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#Documentation/git-merge-index.txt--a)-a 
    
Run merge against all files in the index that need merging. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#Documentation/git-merge-index.txt--o)-o 
    
Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all of them in one shot - continue with merging even when previous merges returned errors, and only return the error code after all the merges. 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-index#Documentation/git-merge-index.txt--q)-q 
    
Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge program failure usually indicates conflicts during the merge). This is for porcelains which might want to emit custom messages.
If _git merge-index_ is called with multiple <file>s (or -a) then it processes them in turn only stopping if merge returns a non-zero exit code.
Typically this is run with a script calling Git’s imitation of the _merge_ command from the RCS package.
A sample script called _git merge-one-file_ is included in the distribution.
ALERT ALERT ALERT! The Git "merge object order" is different from the RCS _merge_ program merge object order. In the above ordering, the original is first. But the argument order to the 3-way merge program _merge_ is to have the original in the middle. Don’t ask me why.
Examples:
```
torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test> git merge-index cat MM
This is MM from the original tree.		# original
This is modified MM in the branch A.		# merge1
This is modified MM in the branch B.		# merge2
This is modified MM in the branch B.		# current contents
```

or
```
torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test> git merge-index cat AA MM
cat: : No such file or directory
This is added AA in the branch A.
This is added AA in the branch B.
This is added AA in the branch B.
fatal: merge program failed
```

where the latter example shows how _git merge-index_ will stop trying to merge once anything has returned an error (i.e., `cat` returned an error for the AA file, because it didn’t exist in the original, and thus _git merge-index_ didn’t even try to merge the MM thing).
