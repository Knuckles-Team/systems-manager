##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged#_name)NAME
git-whatchanged - Show logs with differences each commit introduces
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged#_synopsis)SYNOPSIS
```
git whatchanged _<option>_…​
```

##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged#_warning)WARNING
`git` `whatchanged` has been deprecated and is scheduled for removal in a future version of Git, as it is merely `git` `log` with different defaults.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged#_description)DESCRIPTION
Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.
New users are encouraged to use [git-log[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) instead. The `whatchanged` command is essentially the same as [git-log[1]](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) but defaults to showing the raw format diff output and skipping merges:
```
git log --raw --no-merges
```

The command is primarily kept for historical reasons; fingers of many people who learned Git long before `git` `log` was invented by reading the Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.
##  [](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged#_examples)Examples

Show as patches the commits since version _v2.6.12_ that changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories 

[](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-whatchanged#Documentation/git-whatchanged.txt-gitwhatchanged--since2weeksago--gitk)`git` `whatchanged` `--since="2` `weeks` `ago"` `--` `gitk` 
    
Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file _gitk_. The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the **branch** named _gitk_
